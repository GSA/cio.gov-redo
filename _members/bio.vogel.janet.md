In June 2021 Janet L.D. Vogel was appointed as the Acting Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
 
Janet provides leadership and oversight of the information technology (IT) systems and security activities for a workforce of over 83,000.  As the head of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), she leads the Department’s efforts in developing and implementing IT policies, managing high priority projects, and planning strategic IT investments.  As the CIO, Janet also provides leadership and oversight of the Department’s $6.3B IT portfolio in support of its expansive mission to enhance the health and well-being of Americans.
 
Janet concurrently serves as the HHS Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and has served in that position since 2018.  As the CISO, she has initiated transformation projects related to machine learning, authorization to operate, and cybersecurity reporting standardization.  
 
Prior to joining the HHS Office of the Secretary, Janet served as the Deputy CIO and Deputy Director for Operations at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Information Technology.  Janet also served as the Director for the Financial Management Systems Group at the CMS Office of Financial Management.  In this role, Janet led the software development, implementation, and technical operation of the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System, a secure, integrated, Internet-based accounting system, through which CMS manages financial transactions.  Additionally, her experience includes directing data projects, such as the One PI, providing system maintenance of Provider Enrollment and Integrity systems, and implementing Health Insurance Marketplace capabilities.  
 
Janet’s experience in hands-on IT management spans over 30 years of Federal service, implementing the Federal Shared System for human resources management at the U.S. Treasury, directing IT policy and implementing the fee-for-service management of systems at the Federal Aviation Administration, and managing computer hardware, software, and support service acquisitions world-wide for the Agency for International Development.  Her wealth of experience in policy, procurement, human resources, cybersecurity, and IT solutions will ensure that OCIO continues to deliver, grow, and empower HHS using technology.
 
Janet holds a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and a Master of Arts in Political Science and Public Administration, both from Colorado State University.
