Ms. Aronson is a highly skilled and gifted creative thinker, strategist, and artist; and, was recognized in 2013 as one of the FCW Fed 100 for her mastery of innovation and for her ability to effectively engage her staff around a common vision for cutting-edge IT in support of NSF-funded cutting-edge research. Ms. Aronson’s deep understanding of IT, coupled with her commitment to the NSF mission, its employees and to the American taxpayer, have been instrumental in her ability to manage an organization of over 300 talented IT innovators who feel equally engaged, connected, and empowered to find creative solutions to IT’s most challenging dilemmas.
