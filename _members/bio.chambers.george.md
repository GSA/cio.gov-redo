Dr. George J. Chambers was appointed as the Acting Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 1, 2022. 

George provides leadership and oversight of the information technology (IT) systems and security activities for a workforce of over 83,000.  As the head of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), he leads the Department’s efforts in developing and implementing IT policies, managing high priority projects, and planning strategic IT investments.  As the CIO, George also provides leadership and oversight of the Department’s $7B IT portfolio in support of its expansive mission to enhance the health and well-being of Americans.

Immediately prior, George served as the Executive Director, Office of Application & Platform Solutions for cloud modernization and enterprise ready shared services for OCIO.  He was responsible for innovation, modernization, and strategic direction for high value mission-based systems, databases, integration platforms, and cybersecurity for applications and data investments across the enterprise.  Using agile, low code, and user-centered design frameworks, George and his team helped deliver significant agency outcomes for geographically dispersed and scaled use cases with performance reporting in a complex and highly federated organizational environment.

George received his Ph.D. in Health Policy from the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia concentrating on clinical research and analytics.  In addition to his public service at HHS, George served as a Research Affiliate with the National Center of Homelessness Among Veterans under the Department of Veterans Affairs.  In that voluntary role, George conducted research investigations associated with veterans from the Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom conflicts and worked to identify medical correlates and prevention interventions relating to the unfortunate occurrences of veteran homelessness.

George was also a founding member and served as Board President of Odyssey Charter School in Delaware for the first 12 years of the school’s inception.  Students go to this K-12 public school for free and receive instruction in the classic Greek language with subject content focused on mathematics, the sciences, and humanities.  George was instrumental in the development of curriculum innovations at Odyssey in areas such as FLES (foreign language Elementary School) and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math).  These propelled this non-profit K–12 academic institution to the ranking of “Superior School” in the state of Delaware.
