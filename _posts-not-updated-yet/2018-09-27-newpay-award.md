**WASHINGTON, D.C.** – Today, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) announced the award of a 10-year, $2.5 billion NewPay Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that will provide payroll and work schedule and leave management Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions and services. Payroll modernization aligns with the fifth Cross Agency Priority goal from the President’s Management Agenda, which calls for streamlining administrative services across the federal government.

The BPA uses common, governmentwide standards built collaboratively with current payroll providers and subject matter experts from across government. These standards allow the government to adopt innovative commercial solutions and gain efficiencies and economies of scale.

“GSA is excited to deliver increased value to taxpayers and offer our partners in government a modern, efficient and effective approach to payroll through NewPay,” said GSA Administrator Emily Murphy. ”NewPay strongly aligns with the Trump administration’s efforts to be more efficient, make wise investments of taxpayer funds and shift the focus from low to high-value work by modernizing government processes and systems. Additionally, by utilizing SaaS solutions, NewPay will continue to create ongoing value by empowering agencies to continue modernizing their systems.”

“Today’s announcement of the NewPay awardees is an important step in our Shared Services journey as part of the President’s Management Agenda,” said Federal Chief Information Officer Suzette Kent. “I look forward to seeing federal agencies have the opportunity to utilize leading business capabilities and dedicate greater agency focus on mission.”

“NewPay demonstrates how the government will better coordinate and document common business needs across agencies by focusing on outcomes, data, and cross-functional end-to-end business processes,” said GSA Deputy Associate Administrator for Government-wide Policy Beth Angerman. “Common standards are the key that will drive economies of scale and leverage the government’s buying power.”

BPAs were awarded to the following teams:

* Team Carahsoft: Carahsoft Technology Corporation, Immix Technology, and Deloitte Consulting LLP
* Solution: Kronos and SAP
* Team Grant Thornton: Grant Thornton, The Arcanum Group, Inc., and CGI Federal
