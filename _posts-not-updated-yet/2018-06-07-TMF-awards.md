Washington, D.C. - The Technology Modernization Board, chaired by the Federal Chief Information Officer in the Office of Management and Budget, announced its first round of funding awards under the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF). TMF was authorized by Congress as a mechanism to finance technology modernization efforts across the Federal Government.

The Board approved proposals submitted by the Department of Energy, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Agriculture. "The Technology Modernization Fund is an innovative funding model that allows Agencies to accelerate key IT modernization projects in support of the President's Management Agenda."

The Board believes these projects deliver citizen benefits, meet the specific technology transformation goals defined in the MGT Act, have agency leadership support, and contains effective cost savings strategy that are at the heart of the TMF model."

"The Technology Modernization Fund provides Federal agencies with a novel, new approach to investing in modern technology solutions that will bring about the updated, enhanced and secure platforms necessary to better serve our citizens," said Emily W. Murphy, Administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration.
