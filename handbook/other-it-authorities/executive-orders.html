<h2><strong>3.1 Executive Orders (EOs)</strong></h2>
<p>An EO is a declaration by the president which has the force of law, usually based on existing statutory powers, and requiring no action by the Congress. They are numbered consecutively, so executive orders may be referenced by their assigned number, or their topic. A sitting U.S. President may overturn an existing executive order (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders">Federal Register. Executive Orders. All Executive Orders Since 1994</a>) by issuing another executive order to that effect.
