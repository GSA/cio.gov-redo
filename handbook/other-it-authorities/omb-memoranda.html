<h2><strong>3.3 OMB Memoranda</strong></h2>
<p>The OMB memoranda provides Federal agencies with instructions and implementation guidance for specific management priorities or legislative requirements. They provide annual updates, such as for FISMA reporting requirements, or have longer term guidance for agency implementation. While some memoranda have built in expiration dates, there have been some examples of previous memoranda being rescinded, such as in M-17-15 (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-15.pdf">OMB M-17-15. Rescission of Memoranda Relating to Identity Management. 1/19/2017</a>) and M-17-26. (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/M-17-26.pdf">OMB M-17-26. Reducing Burden for Federal Agencies by Rescinding and Modifying OMB Memoranda. 6/15/2017</a>.)</p>
