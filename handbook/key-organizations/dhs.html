<h2><strong>5.3 Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</strong></h2>
<p>The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 gives responsibility to the DHS, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Justice (DOJ) to &ldquo;develop procedures to share cybersecurity threat information with private entities, non federal agencies, state, tribal, and local governments, the public, and entities under threats.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754">S.754 - Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015</a>.) FISMA 2014 amended FISMA 2002 by &ldquo;codifying DHS authority&rdquo; to oversee information security policies for non-national security federal Executive Branch systems. (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act">CISA. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014</a>.)</p>
<p>In accordance with CISA, DHS must establish processes where private sector entities can share information about cybersecurity threats with the Federal Government. DHS manages the delivery and adoption of BODs to federal agencies.</p>
<p>The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) works within DHS to prevent cyberthreats and coordinate incident response activities. US-CERT works with federal agencies, private sector, research entities, state and local government and international groups to protect the national technology landscape. (<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/infosheet_US-CERT_v2.pdf">US-CERT. Infosheet</a>.) The Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program &ldquo;delivers&nbsp;automated tools&rdquo; to federal agencies to build defense against threats to the national technology infrastructure.

<p><strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</strong></p>
<p>As the first federal agency responsible for protecting our Nation’s physical and cyber infrastructure, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the driving force mobilizing a collective defense to understand and manage risk to our critical infrastructure. In order to do this, CISA provides programs and services across the public and private sectors, as well as the international community, based on a comprehensive understanding of the risk environment and the corresponding needs identified by stakeholders. CISA aims to help organizations better manage risk and increase resilience using all available resources, whether provided by the Federal Government, commercial vendors, or their own capabilities.</p>
<p>Codified under the 2014 Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), DHS is charged with administering the implementation of information security policies for federal Executive Branch civilian agencies, overseeing agencies’ compliance with those policies, and assisting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in developing those policies. Through these initiatives, CISA is focused on assessing systemic risks that could affect the federal enterprise as a whole and making recommendations to departments and agencies, while adjusting government-wide policies as necessary. Through these authorities, CISA supports departments and agencies as they work to improve their Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) Cyber Component scores. CISA supports federal Executive Branch civilian agencies in a variety of ways including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Offers tools to safeguard civilian executive branch networks guidance.</li>
    <li>Measures and motivates agencies to implement policies, directives, standards and guidelines. </li>
    <li>Serves as a hub for information sharing and incident reporting; and</li>
    <li>Provides operational technical assistance, including threat information dissemination and risk vulnerability assessments, as well as incident response services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these programs and services, CISA provides departments and agencies comprehensive visibility into all systems across the enterprise, assists with upgrading or replacing legacy tools, and ensures the tools deployed are optimized for emerging hybrid environments.

<p><strong>Continuous Diagnostic Mitigation (CDM) Program</strong></p>
<p>The CDM Program works under CISA to strengthen the cybersecurity of federal departments and agencies. CDM offers &ldquo;industry-leading, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tools to support technical modernization as threats change.&rdquo; This program meets FISMA mandates and delivers four main objectives: reducing threats at the agency level, increasing visibility into the strengths of federal cybersecurity, improving cybersecurity response capabilities, and streamlining FISMA reporting.</p>
<p><strong>US-CERT</strong></p>
<p>US-CERT works under CISA to prevent cyberthreats and coordinate incident response activities. US-CERT works with federal agencies, private sector, research entities, state and local government and international groups to protect the national technology landscape. (<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/infosheet_US-CERT_v2.pdf">US-CERT. Infosheet</a>.)</p>
<p>Core Activities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Providing cybersecurity protection to Federal civilian executive branch agencies through intrusion detection and prevention capabilities.</li>
    <li>Developing timely and actionable information for distribution to Federal departments and agencies; state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments; critical infrastructure owners and operators; private industry; and international organizations.</li>
    <li>Responding to incidents and analyzing data about emerging cybersecurity threats.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with foreign governments and international entities to enhance the nation&rsquo;s cybersecurity posture. (<a href="https://www.cio.gov/assets/resources/CISO_Handbook.pdf">CIO Council. CISO Handbook</a>.)</li>
