<h2><strong>5.7 National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)</strong></h2>
<p>NARA preserves documents, materials and records involving the Federal Government. (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/about">NARA. About the National Archives</a>.) NARA collects and maintains declassified information and makes it available for research purposes. In 2019, OMB issued Memorandum M-19-21 providing guidance to all federal agencies to manage records digitally by December 31, 2022, requiring NARA to be accessible in a fully electronic format. (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/policy/m-19-21-transition-to-federal-records.pdf">OMB M-19-21. Transition to Electronic Records. 6/28/2019</a>.) This terminated any paper or hard copy systems involving the maintenance of electronic records.</p>
<p>NARA defines essential records as documentation allowing agencies to fulfill their operational needs under a national security threat or emergency, or to safeguard the legal and financial rights of the Federal Government. (<a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/essential-records/essential-records-guide.pdf">NARA. Essential Records Guide. August 2018</a>.) NARA directs the heads of federal agencies with specific responsibilities in managing essential records including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and maintain records for the agency;</li>
<li>Establish programs to manage records to properly identify information for public disclosure and in a digital format, among other standards;</li>
<li>Transfer of records to record centers;</li>
<li>Developing protections to prevent loss of records; and</li>
<li>Notifying Archivist of unlawful activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>NARA&rsquo;s Code of Federal Regulations require agencies to establish electronic information systems and evaluate them to check for accuracy. Otherwise, &ldquo;agencies must submit an SF 115, Request for Records Disposition Authority, to NARA.&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2cb32d56fb6af59e4b4ee022f092b321&mc=true&node=pt36.3.1236&rgn=div5">36 C.F.R. &sect;1236.26(a). Electronic Records Management</a>.)</p>
