<h2><strong>5.1 Office of Management &amp; Budget (OMB)</strong></h2>
<p>OMB is responsible for overseeing Federal agencies&rsquo; information technology practices. As a part of this core function, OMB develops and ensures implementation of policies and guidelines that drive enhanced technology performance and budgeting across the Executive Branch. The Federal CIO heads OMB&rsquo;s Office of E-Government and Information Technology (E-Gov), which develops and provides direction in the use of Internet-based technologies. The two major policies and guidelines are FITARA and FISMA.</p>
<p>With FITARA, the Common Baseline was set forth and the role of Agency CIOs was expanded with increased responsibilities through the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148%5D">Public Law 113-291. Sec. 831. National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015</a>.) Per OMB M-15-14, the specific requirements of FITARA include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Agency CIO Authority Enhancements</li>
    <li>Enhanced Transparency and Improved Risk Management in IT Investments</li>
    <li>Portfolio Review</li>
    <li>Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative</li>
    <li>Expansion of Training and Use of IT Cadres</li>
    <li>Maximizing the Benefit of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative</li>
    <li>Governmentwide Software Purchasing Program (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-14.pdf">OMB M-15-14. Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology. 6/10/2015</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>With FISMA, information security requirements were set forth based on NIST compliance documents. (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/federal-information-security-management-act-fisma-implementation-project">NIST. Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Implementation Project</a>.) FISMA requires annual evaluations of the information security program at each federal agency, which are reviewed by DHS and OMB, and incorporated into an annual report to Congress. FISMA states:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Director [OMB] shall oversee agency information security policies and practices, including developing and overseeing the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security.</li>
    <li>Not later than March 1 of each year, the Director [OMB], in consultation with the Secretary [DHS], shall submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of information security policies and practices during the preceding year.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each year, not later than such date established by the Director [OMB], the head of each agency shall submit to the Director [OMB] the results of [their agency&rsquo;s] evaluation required under this section.
