<p><strong>Enterprise Architecture</strong><br /> Agencies shall develop an enterprise architecture (EA) that describes the baseline architecture, target architecture, and a transition plan to get to the target architecture. The agency&rsquo;s EA shall align to their IRM Strategic Plan. The EA should incorporate agency plans for significant upgrades, replacements, and&nbsp;disposition of information systems when the systems can no longer effectively support missions or business functions.
