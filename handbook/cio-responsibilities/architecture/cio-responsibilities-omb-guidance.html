<h2><strong>1.7.2 CIO Responsibilities – OMB Guidance</strong></h2>
<p>This section consists of language from OMB guidance that further demarcates, expands upon, or otherwise clarifies the responsibilities of agency CIOs with regards to their agency&rsquo;s architecture. See sections on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/handbook/other-it-authorities/omb-memoranda/">OMB Memoranda</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/handbook/other-it-authorities/omb-circulars/">OMB Circulars</a> for more information about these forms of OMB guidance. See sections on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/handbook/key-organizations/oig/">OIG</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/handbook/key-organizations/gao/">GAO</a> to review how compliance with policies is measured.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Architecture</strong><br /> Agencies shall develop an enterprise architecture (EA) that describes the baseline architecture, target architecture, and a transition plan to get to the target architecture. The agency&rsquo;s EA shall align to their IRM Strategic Plan. The EA should incorporate agency plans for significant upgrades, replacements, and&nbsp;disposition of information systems when the systems can no longer effectively support missions or business functions.
