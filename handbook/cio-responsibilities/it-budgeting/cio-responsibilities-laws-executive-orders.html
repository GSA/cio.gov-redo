<h2><strong>1.4.1 CIO Responsibilities - Laws and Executive Orders</strong></h2>
<p>CIOs are responsible for the processes for all annual and multi-year IT planning, programming, and budgeting decisions. This section lists the statutory responsibilities of CIOs related to budgeting. The statutory language is <em>directly pulled </em>from applicable laws and executive orders. These statutory responsibilities are then implemented through OMB guidance and guidance from other government- wide organizations. This language, along with the language in other sections under the heading &ldquo;CIO Responsibilities &ndash; Laws and Executive Orders,&rdquo; defines the CIO role and gives the CIO their statutory mandate.</p>
