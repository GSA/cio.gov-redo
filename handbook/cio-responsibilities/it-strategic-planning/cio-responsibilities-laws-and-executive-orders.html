<h2><strong>1.2.1 CIO Responsibilities - Laws and Executive Orders</strong></h2>
<p>CIOs are responsible for strategic planning for all IT management functions. This section lists the statutory responsibilities of CIOs related to strategic planning. The statutory language is directly pulled from applicable laws and executive orders. These statutory responsibilities are then implemented through OMB guidance and guidance from other government-wide organizations. This language, along with the language in other sections under the heading “CIO Responsibilities - Laws and Executive Orders,” defines the CIO role and gives the CIO their statutory mandate.</p>
