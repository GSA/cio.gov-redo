<h2><strong>6.4 <a href="https://www.cio.gov/policies-and-priorities/cpic/">Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC)</a></strong></h2>
<p>The Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 requires OMB to establish a budget process of analyzing, tracking, and evaluating the risks and results of IT projects. The law requires federal executive departments and agencies use the CPIC process outlined by OMB Circular A-130. (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf">OMB Circular A-130. Managing Information as a Strategic Resource. Policy. July 2016</a>.)</p>
<p>CPIC is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. Every year, agencies report IT investments to OMB to inform the President&rsquo;s Budget. (<a href="https://www.ocio.usda.gov/about-ocio/information-resource-management/capital-planning-and-investment-control">USDA. Capital Planning and Investment Control</a>.)</p>
<p>OMB requires agency CIOs, SAOPs, CFOs, and budget officers coordinate to ensure that IT budget data is consistent with the agency&rsquo;s budget submission.</p>
