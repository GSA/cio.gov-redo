<h2><strong>6.6 Data Center and Cloud Optimization Initiative (DCCOI)</strong></h2>
M-19-19, enacted in June 2019, established the DCCOI which replaced the previous DCOI from M-16-19. Compared to M-16-19, key features of M-19-19 include:
<ul>
    <li>Continuation of the development freeze for new and current data centers;</li>
    <li>Continuation of consolidation and closure of existing data centers;</li>
    <li>Alignment of consolidation and closure of existing data centers with the Cloud Smart (<a href="https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/">OMB. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy</a>) strategy;</li>
    <li>Continuation of the DCCOI PMO;</li>
    <li>Increased alignment with the PMA; (<a href="https://www.performance.gov/index.html#president-agenda">The White House. President's Management Agenda</a>)</li>
    <li>Broadening of the exemptions for some data centers from closures that did not fit the definition set forth in M-16-19 (e.g. unique examples from embassy file servers to dam floodgate controls, federal labs and research facilities) with provisional exemptions applied by OMB after justified agency requests;</li>
    <li>Updated closures and cost savings targets; and</li>
    <li>Updated performance metrics to focus less on averages and more on continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of specific performance metrics, M-19-19 adds a metric for planned hours of availability for each data center, updates the advanced energy metering, virtualization, and server utilization metrics, and removes the energy efficiency and facility utilization metrics.</p>
