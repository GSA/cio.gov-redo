<h2><strong>6.3 TechStat</strong></h2>
<p>A TechStat is a face-to-face, evidence-based accountability review between OMB and a covered agency of an IT program with that agency&rsquo;s leadership. TechStat sessions are a tool for getting ahead of critical problems in an investment, turning around underperforming investments, or terminating investments if appropriate. Agencies report the outcomes of all TechStat sessions through the quarterly IDC process. (<a href="https://management.cio.gov/implementation/">OMB. Implementation Guide - FITARA</a>.)</p>
