<h2><strong>4.14 General Counsel</strong></h2>
<p>The General Counsel is the chief legal officer of the agency, providing legal advice and representation to GSA officials while ensuring implementation of GSA's statutory responsibilities. The lawyers within an agency’s Office of General Counsel provide legal counsel to agency policy-makers, providing critical input to rules, regulations, and guidance documents that are promulgated and issued to implement an agency’s statutory obligations. Each agency’s OGC varies in organization and structure to meet individual agency-specific mission and needs.</p>
<p>An agency’s general counsel can be an important partner for the CIO on a variety of IT-related initiatives. Your agency’s GC will be a key stakeholder in IT procurement and contract management, as well as meeting policy and statutory requirements for IT management and information security compliance.</p>
