The agency CDO will be a trusted partner for the agency CIO in developing and implementing policies and statutory requirements related to the management of agency data.</p>

    <li>Coordinate with any official in the agency responsible for using, protecting, disseminating, and generating data to ensure that the data needs of the agency are met;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>CDO Council</strong><br />
The CDO Council established by the Evidence Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174">Public Law 115-435. Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018</a>) includes all agency Chief Data Officers, the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government (or designee), the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (or designee), and an Ex Officio Member (to represent all Chief Information Officers and Evaluation Officers). The CDO Council meets regularly to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Establish government-wide best practices for the use, protection, dissemination, and generation of data;</li>
    <li>Promote and encourage data sharing agreements between agencies;</li>
    <li>Identify ways in which agencies can improve upon the production of evidence for use in policymaking; consult with the public and engage with private users of Government data and other stakeholders on how to improve access to data assets of the Federal Government; and</li>
    <li>Identify and evaluate new technology solutions for improving the collection and use of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDO Council’s resources will reflect consultation with the public and engagement with private users of government data and other stakeholders on how to improve access to Federal data assets. In addition, the CDO Council will identify and evaluate new technology solutions for improving the collection and use of data. The CDO Council will share responsibility with other government-wide councils that conduct statutory, data-related activities, such as the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) and the Evaluation Officer Council. OMB expects that the activities of these multiple councils will be coordinated through the OMB Federal Data Policy Committee.</p>
