<h2><strong>9.4 GSA Resources</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) Special Item Numbers (SINs)</strong><br />
    GSA, in collaboration with DHS and OMB, developed the Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) Special Item Numbers (SINs) to make it easier for agencies to procure quality cybersecurity services. (<a href="https://interact.gsa.gov/document/it-security-gsas-highly-adaptive-cybersecurity-services-hacs-special-item-number-sin">GSA. IT Security: GSA's Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS) Special Item Number (SIN)</a>.) The program is designed to provide government organizations with access to cybersecurity vendors and to meet the IT security requirements outlined in OMB M-19-03, (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/M-19-03.pdf">OMB M-19-03. Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Agencies by enhancing the High Value Asset Program. 12/10/2018</a>.) M-17-12, (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-12_0.pdf">OMB M-17-12. Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information. 1/3/2017</a>) and the CISO Handbook. (<a href="https://www.cio.gov/resources/ciso-handbook/">CIO Council. Guidance for Chief Information Security Officers (CISO)</a>.) They are available through the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) IT procurement process.</p>
    <p>The scope of HACS SINs includes five categories of cybersecurity services for which vendors in the GSA eLibrary have passed a technical evaluation for the categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High Value Asset Assessments
            <ul>
                <li>Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVA)</li>
                <li>Security Architecture Review (SAR)</li>
                <li>Systems Security Engineering (SSE)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>RVA</li>
        <li>Cyber Hunt</li>
        <li>Incident Response</li>
        <li>Penetration Testing (<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/technology-products-services/it-security/highly-adaptive-cybersecurity-services-hacs">GSA. Highly Adaptive Cybersecurity Services (HACS))</a></li>
    </ul>
