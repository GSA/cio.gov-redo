<h2><strong>2.13 Geospatial Data Act (2018)</strong></h2>
<p>Codifies the Federal Geographic Data Committee and supports the National Spatial Data Infrastructure</p>
<p>The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 (GDA) became law on October 5, 2018. The GDA was included as a component of the FAA Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-254, Subtitle F). The GDA codifies the committees, processes, and tools used to develop, drive, and manage the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and recognizes responsibilities beyond the Federal government for its development. The GDA reflects growing recognition of the essential role of geospatial data and technology in understanding and managing our world and highlights the need to support their continuing development as critical investments for the Nation. (<a href="https://www.fgdc.gov/gda/gda-fact-sheet-may-2019.pdf">Federal Geographic Data Committee. Geospatial Data Act of 2018</a>.)</p>
<p>The GDA reduces duplicative efforts and facilitates the efficient procurement of geospatial expertise, technology, services, and data from the rapidly growing geographic community in the United States. The GDA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligns business strategies and technology;</li>
<li>Ensures that resources are managed in accordance with the Nation&rsquo;s needs and priorities; and</li>
<li>Ensures that all technology resources and employees are utilized in a manner that provides the best value for the Nation</li>
</ul>
