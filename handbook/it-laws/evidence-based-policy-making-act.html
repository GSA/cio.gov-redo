<p>Establishes processes for the federal government to modernize data management practices, evidence- building functions, and statistical efficiency. (<a href="https://www.cio.gov/policies-and-priorities/evidence-based-policymaking/">CIO. Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018</a>.)</p>
<p>The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (or OPEN Government Data Act, Pub.L. 115&ndash;435) is a United States law that requires the federal government to modernize its data management practices.</p>
<p>The bill requires agencies to submit annually to [OMB] and Congress a systematic plan for identifying and addressing policy questions. The plan must include, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions for developing evidence to support policymaking;</li>
<li>Data the agency intends to collect, use, or acquire to facilitate the use of evidence in policymaking;</li>
<li>Methods and analytical approaches that may be used to develop evidence to support policymaking; and</li>
<li>Challenges to developing evidence to support policymaking, including any statutory or other restrictions to accessing relevant data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each agency shall designate a senior employee as Evaluation Officer to coordinate evidence-building activities and an official with statistical expertise to advise on statistical policy, techniques, and procedures.</p>
