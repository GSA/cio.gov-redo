<h2><strong>2.5 Privacy Act (1974)</strong></h2>
<p>The Privacy Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2018-title5/pdf/USCODE-2018-title5-partI-chap5-subchapII-sec552a.pdf">5 U.S.C. &sect; 552a. Title 5 Government Organizations and Employees</a>) establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by Federal agencies. A system of records is defined as a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act requires that agencies give the public notice of their systems of records by publication in the Federal Register. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. The Act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements.
