<h2><strong>2.16 Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act (2019)</strong></h2>
<p>Enacted in 2019, the Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents (CASES) Act directs OMB to require each federal agency to accept electronic identity proofing and authentication processes that allow an individual, under the [Privacy Act of 1974], to access the individual's records or to provide prior written consent for the disclosure of the individual's records. (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/435">Creating Advanced Streamlined Electronic Services for Constituents Act of 2019</a>.) The bill modernizes the way members of Congress receive permission from constituents before contacting federal agencies on their behalf. Instead of a paper submission, constituents who request casework from their congressional representatives every year have the option of submitting a privacy release form electronically.</p>
