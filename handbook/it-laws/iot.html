<h2><strong>2.17 Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Enacted in 2020 to establish minimum security standards for [Internet of Things (IoT)] devices owned and controlled by the federal government. This law gives authority to the CIO to prohibit the head of any agency from &ldquo;procuring or obtaining, renewing a contract to procure or obtain, or using an [IoT] device&rdquo; if they find through a mandatory review process that the use of the device prevents compliance with NIST standards and guidelines.</p>
<p>The CIO can waive this requirement only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the waiver is necessary in the interest of national security;</li>
<li>procuring, obtaining, or using such device is necessary for research purposes; or</li>
<li>such device is secured using alternative and effective methods appropriate to the function of such device. (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th- congress/house-bill/1668/text"> Public Law 116-207. IoT CyberSecurity Improvement Act of 2020</a>.)</li>
