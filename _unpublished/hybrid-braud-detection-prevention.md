**The Purpose**

The Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council Innovation Committee accelerates the adoption of new practices, processes, and technologies in the U.S. Government. In FY24, the Committee is delivering programming to humanize Federal IT Operating Plan priorities and illustrate the impact that they have on public-facing ser vices.

The Symposium Series creates a forum for two -way dialogue across federal, state and local governments, academia, and the private sector to focus on current and futuristic topics impacting agencies today. The government is bringing a challenge and opportunity to partner with industry and others to learn from one another on the impact of IT Modernization on supporting the public.

The Symposiums are held at General Services Administration (GSA) headquarters at [1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1800+F+Street+NW,+Washington,+DC?entry=gmail&source=g).
