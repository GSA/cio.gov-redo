On November 6th and 7th, the Federal Chief Information Officers Council will host the first-ever, government-wide Federal Tech/Cyber Hiring and Recruitment Event at the Silver Spring Civic Building at Veterans Plaza in Silver Spring, MD.

The Federal Government is seeking top information technology and cybersecurity talent to fill critical skills gaps. Data architects, computer scientists, cyber analysts, engineers, mathematicians, and project managers are needed to defend the nation’s infrastructure, deliver digital services to the American people, and modernize the Federal Government’s IT systems and operations.

Over twenty federal agencies will be collaboratively recruiting, interviewing, and hiring applicants, on the spot, in a streamlined hiring process. Additionally, participants will have access to free training seminars that will cover resume writing, interviewing, and applying to Federal Government jobs. Webinars on these topics will also be made available to applicants prior to the event.

Candidates of all experience levels are welcome to apply to position openings on USAJOBS. To be considered for an interview at the event, applicants must first register for the event and then apply to openings no later than Sept 29th. Please note that candidates who do not receive an interview or a conditional offer at the event may still be considered for future opportunities after the event.
