**Washington** - Today, the Office of Management and Budget, the CIO Council and the Department of Education announced the first Federal Cyber Reskilling Academy (FCRA) pilot program. This program offers Federal employees the opportunity for hands-on training in cybersecurity, one of the fastest growing fields in the country. This reskilling effort is part of the Administration’s commitment to developing a Federal workforce for the 21st century, as outlined in the President’s Management Agenda and the recent Government Reform Plan.

“The Reskilling Academy provides an excellent opportunity for our Federal employees to learn new skills and to gain access to one of the fastest growing job fields in the country,” said **United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos**. “I’m glad the Department of Education can help play a role in this Administration’s investment in our Federal workforce as they continue to develop their talents and take on new challenges.”

“Cybersecurity is a key priority for this Administration. This is why we need to continue to transform and modernize our efforts to improve our cyber posture,” stated **Suzette Kent, Federal CIO**. “I’m thrilled to see the Federal Cyber Reskilling Academy pilot class take off as a path to train federal employees to join our cyber defenders.”
