Administration Announces Cybersecurity Developmental Detail Opportunities

Washington, D.C. – Today, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Chief Information Officers Council, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are pleased to announce the availability of temporary detail opportunities to support the growth and development of the Federal cybersecurity workforce. These details are an opportunity for Federal cybersecurity personnel, including the FY19 Cybersecurity Reskilling Academy graduates, to gain on-the-job experience and to fill work roles of critical cybersecurity needs. Multiple Federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, have committed to offering details in support of reskilling efforts.

“We cannot overcome the shortage in the Federal cybersecurity workforce overnight,” said Federal Chief Information Officer Suzette Kent. “By continuing to invest and support reskilling programs, coupled with hands-on opportunities to apply those skills, the Federal government is positioning itself to strengthen our cybersecurity workforce capabilities.”

OPM Director Dale Cabaniss explained that “by serving as a government-wide bulletin board for short-term assignments, details, and training opportunities around the Federal government, Open Opportunities will help agencies tap into the valuable talent and skills we already have and are developing within government.”
