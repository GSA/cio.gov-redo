The Federal government spends at least $90 billion a year on information technology (IT), nearly threequarters of which pays for maintenance of existing systems.

This case study reviews the largest TBM implementation to date in the public sector, in the State of Washington, to understand the challenges, lessons learned and how greater IT cost transparency is making a positive impact. Implementing TBM is a journey and Washington State still has work to do to fully realize all the benefits of the framework and methodology.
