October 1<sup>st</sup> marks the beginning of the 18<sup>th</sup> annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month where, once again, the Federal Cybersecurity Information Security Officer (CISO) Council is proud to reinforce its commitment to safe and secure online behavior. While remote work continues to be the ‘new normal’, cyber criminals are ramping up their focus on this expanded attack surface and seeking to take advantage of weary workers. Phishing attacks have been on the rise for decades, and this method of attack continues to be one of the most dangerous threats to an organization and the easiest way for an attacker to deliver malicious or weaponized payloads.

An organization’s first line of defense against phishing is training and awareness. Train, exercise, assess, re-train is the best way to improve the workforces’ ability to identify, understand, and prevent phishing attacks. With that in mind, here are a few tips to Fight the Phish!

**Spear Phishing** targets specific users by researching personal and publicly available information.
* **Secure** personal information online by setting social media accounts to private.
* **Recall** if you have received similar communication from the sender in the past.

**Whale Phishing** targets executives and other high-profile users, using social-engineering tactics to trick them into initiating financial transactions or divulging sensitive information.
* **Check** privacy settings on social media and be careful what you share.
* **Vigilance** is important since these attacks are harder to detect given the reliance on social engineering to trick targeted users and do not always contain a malicious file or link.

**Deceptive Phishing** disguises as a credible sender and imitates a legitimate source to steal personal data.
* **Inspect** URLs to identify redirection to unknown or suspicious websites.
* **Review** sender’s email address for unfamiliar, misspelled, or odd domain names.

**Clone Phishing** resends near identical email to a user and replaces a valid link/attachment with a malicious version.
* **Verify** legitimacy of identical email received by contacting sender via phone.
* **Compare** email with original version to identify differences to link address or attachment size.

**Angler Phishing** masquerades as a social media customer service representative notifying a user of account issues while seeking to gain unauthorized access to credentials.
* **Research** customer service account to ensure it is a valid account belonging to the social media platform.
* **Contact** the social media’s customer service department directly to verify validity of the issue.

**Vishing & Smishing** imitates a known company and contacts user via call or text attempting to steal sensitive information.
* **Beware** of false claims or frequent name dropping of colleagues that tie the attacker to your organization.
* **Recognize** pushy and “too-good-to-be-true” offers like “act fast” and “sign up now.”

As you can see, there are a lot of fishy phish out there ready to attack if you let down your guard. Attackers are quite skilled at adapting their techniques to situations and make it difficult to discern whether content is genuine or a potential threat. Take a moment to think about what you have learned and share this information with your colleagues, family, and friends. Cybersecurity awareness is a continuous process and during Cybersecurity Awareness Month we want to focus on training and education that enables everyone to do their part to be cyber smart.
