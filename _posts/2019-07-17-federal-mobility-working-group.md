The Federal CIO Council is excited to unveil the Federal Mobility Group (FMG), a federal Community of Practice that coalesces the membership and goals of the existing Mobile Services Category Team (MSCT) with those of the Mobile Technology Tiger Team (MTTT). The MSCT was established in 2016 by the OMB Category Management Leadership Council (via memo M-16-20), with a mission to improve acquisition and management of mobile devices and services. The MTTT, chartered by the Federal CIO Council in 2013 to address mobile security requirements of the Digital Government Strategy, is charged with monitoring mobile security technologies and initiatives to ensure the evolution of federal mobile security after the Strategy is implemented.

Comprised of mobility subject matter experts from Departments and Agencies across the Federal Government, the MSCT and MTTT have been partnering for nearly two years to address common mobility challenges. Consolidating the two groups into the FMG merely crystalizes the partnership, which now positions the team to respond to the evolving definition and emerging technologies that comprise the mobility landscape. The FMG provides a singular conduit for the federal mobile community, whose purpose is to share information and identify cross-agency needs for mobile policy, guidance and best practices, acquisition of mobile devices and services, and operational requirements for federal mobility programs.

The FMG is co-chaired by mobile leaders from Department of Homeland Security, General Services Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and includes three at-large agency representatives. The FMG reports to the Federal CIO Council with executive sponsorship from Renee Wynn, CIO of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). To ensure that the FMG appropriately considers acquisition policy and priorities set by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the FMG has a matrixed reporting relationship to the Federal IT Category Manager.  

The FMG will be tackling several initiatives including:
* Streamlining the inventory data call spend surveys
* Accelerating the inclusion of mobile into the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program
* Providing an implementerâ€™s perspective for development and updating of NIST standards and guidance for secure mobility

Visit the Federal Mobility Group page on [OMB MAX](https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1630801264), to learn more about the FMG and how to become involved in its initiatives.

*The leadership of the FMG extends its sincere appreciation to Renee Wynn, NASA CIO, for her executive sponsorship and guidance through the creation of the FMG. We look forward to continuing our work with our federal partners to address mobility challenges and issues and to celebrate our successes together.*
