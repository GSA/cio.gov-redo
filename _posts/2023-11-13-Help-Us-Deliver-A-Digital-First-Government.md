**Overview**

The [*Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2023/09/22/fact-sheet-building-digital-experiences-for-the-american-people/#:~:text=The%20Delivering%20a%20Digital%2DFirst,experiences%20that%20meet%20today%27s%20expectations.) guidance establishes the foundation for an improved digital experience when the public interacts with the government's products and services. The guidance identifies seven digital experience pillars and the specific actions and standards that agencies must take to accelerate the design, development and delivery of modern websites and digital services. The key pillars are: 

1. **Analytics:** We need improved analytics to better optimize digital experiences
2. **Accessibility:** We need to ensure information and services are accessible to all individuals
3. **Brand:** We need consistent branding to establish greater trust for digital interactions with the government
4. **Content:** We need to de-duplicate and improve content so the public gets one answer -- the right answer -- when they search for information online
5. **Design:** We need consistent design so that it is easier to navigate government websites
6. **Search:** We need to adopt search best practices so that it is easier for the public to find information
7. **Digitization:** We need to continue to identify digitalization opportunities so that it is easier for the public to access services 

Together, these pillars represent the path towards a truly simple, seamless, and secure digital-first public experience. And to deliver it, we must take a whole of government approach. To our industry partners, these pillars represent the government's requirements. They aren't optional; we must -  and will -- implement them. We need solutions that will meet them and deliver these outcomes. It will take us all working together -- across government and industry -- to deliver the digital experience the American public expect and deserve.
