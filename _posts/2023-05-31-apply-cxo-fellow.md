If you are a GS-09 to GS-13 employee (or equivalent) who is passionate about technology, understands how the Federal Government operates, and drives change within your agency, consider [applying](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_cHjX1ugnUiQfEPQ){:target="_blank"} to the CXO Fellows Program. The application period for the FY 2024 cohort ends June 9 at 5 p.m. ET.

Imagine moving to the next level of your career by meeting semi-monthly for one year with other rising leaders in the government fields of Technology, Data, Human Capital, Finance, and Acquisition. Together, you will brainstorm ideas, such as how to strengthen your career trajectory and expand your network. The idea is simple but the positive impact each class of Fellows has on each other is dramatic.

*"I'd describe it as a leadership and development program that brings in speakers to discuss various topics that are critical to understanding how to be a great leader and implement practices that create a comfortable, inclusive environment. It also teaches you how to be your 'PR' person, for lack of better words. However, it's what you make of it. You have to immerse yourself in the material and get in engaged in order to get the most benefit."* - **Jordyn Taylor, a Privacy Liaison and Information Security Officer for the Environmental Protection Agency, CXO Alumnus**

The CXO Fellows Program offers training that will enhance performance in your current role as well as help direct your career with a leadership perspective. The topics discussed by Fellows are chosen specifically to prepare rising leaders for new challenges in their professional lives and to spark innovation within government.

*"CXO Fellows Program is a great opportunity to view the Federal Government from the vantage point of 35,000 feet. You see how the President's Management Agenda provides the overarching umbrella of agency activities that will deliver an exceptional customer experience to the American citizens. Additionally, the CXO Fellows Program allows you to meet other individuals in federal service and develop a bond for future collaborative efforts."* - **Arthur D. Allen, Project Manager at the Department of Veteran Affairs, CXO Alumnus**

CXO Fellows will learn new leadership skills, but more importantly they will learn how to put those skills into action. After all, an effective leader needs to be a great motivator and the ability to motivate others comes from having great people skills. This cross-functional community gives rising leaders the chance to share problem-solving strategies and build relationships by participating in speaker series, development seminars, and networking events.

*"An opportunity to receive guidance and make connections to propel your career in the Federal Government. The first stop if you see yourself as a future leader."* - **Mark Trupiano, IT Specialist for the Department of the Treasury, CXO Alumnus**

The CXO Fellows Program is a great opportunity to invest in yourself and all it will cost you is your time, focus, and commitment to grow.
