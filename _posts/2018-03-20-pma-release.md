The Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of all agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.

The agenda outlines three key drivers of modernizing government for the 21st century:

1. **Modern information technology** that helps Government meet customer expectations and keep data and systems secure in the digital age.
2. **Data, accountability, and transparency initiatives** that deliver visibly better results to the public, while improving accountability to taxpayers.
3. **A Workforce for the 21st century** that enables senior leaders and front-line managers to nimbly align staff skills with evolving mission needs.  

The CIO Council, in collaboration with the other CXO communities, will play a leading role in a number of CAP goals. Read the [full PMA here](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html).
