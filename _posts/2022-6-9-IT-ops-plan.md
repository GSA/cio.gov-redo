Every day, the public experiences well-designed interactions when using consumer products and services. They're easy and intuitive. The public rightfully wants, expects, and deserves the same experience when interacting with the Government -- and it's possible.

Technology underpins our ability to get there. Data enables an enterprise view, provides better insights to agencies' modernization journeys, and optimizes strategic investment decisions through the Information Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR) account, Technology Modernization Fund (TMF), and Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF).

Our efforts seek to <span style="color:#00537C">**rebuild trust in our Government**</span>, <span style="color:#00537C">**ensure no one is left behind**</span>, and <span style="color:#00537C">**inspire others to serve**</span> future generations of our great country.

The collective strengths of the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) tech teams, the Office of the Federal CIO (OFCIO) and U.S. Digital Service (USDS), as well as the General Services Administration, allow us to drive change across Government that we know is possible. OMB -- through OFCIO -- is building an enterprise view of agencies while refreshing IT policy to keep pace with technology, and -- through USDS -- is rapidly responding to critical technology crises while building agencies' technical talent and practices. GSA is partnering with agencies to develop new models and practices, while sustaining modernization by scaling shared services to carry out the long tail of transformation. We are partners united in delivering to the American people the Government they deserve.

OMB's role in overseeing IT expenditures includes assessing the "costs, benefits, and risks" of "all major capital investments made by an executive agency for information systems" and evaluating the performance and results of agencies' IT investments. We take this responsibility seriously. By uniting behind an [IT operating plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/Federal-IT-Operating-Plan-June-2022.pdf) -- enabled by an enterprise view -- we can see what's working, fill tech talent gaps, and help agencies course-correct, while driving innovative ways of working and building modern service delivery into the public's daily interactions with Government.

As we look ahead, OMB will continue to engage agencies to ensure <span style="color:#00537C">**all IT investments**</span> -- not only those made via ITOR, TMF, and FCSF -- <span style="color:#00537C">**are set up for success**</span>.

Great work is underway, and we look forward to sharing updates on our progress. <span style="color:#00537C">**We can and will drive the change we know is possible across Government.**</span>
