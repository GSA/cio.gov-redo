On December 13, 2021, the President signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/) on *Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government*. This EO is about ensuring the Federal Government serves its customers better by [putting people at the center of everything we do](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-putting-the-public-first-improving-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-for-the-american-people/). With this announcement by the President, we in the Federal IT community are being called to action since [it is technology that underpins the Government’s ability to deliver](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2021/12/13/using-technology-to-improve-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-for-the-american-people/) a more simple, seamless, and secure customer experience for the American public.

 

As a former Federal CIO, I know how many things you are asked to do on a daily basis to carry out your work, often in the most challenging of circumstances. This is why you will not be alone on this journey. Our team in the Office of the Federal CIO, along with our Federal Chief Information Security Officer, will be partnering with the CIO and CISO communities to support you in this effort. We’ll be providing guidance in developing and deploying enterprise cyber and IT modernization roadmaps, sharing playbooks and lessons learned from other agencies to help create momentum across your agency, and working with your Department and Agency leaders to ensure they fully support your teams’ efforts to execute on these Presidential priorities.

 

The coming year is going to be exciting – and we’re going to take these steps together, as one Federal team serving one America. I look forward to going on this journey with you. As we get ready to close out 2021, I hope you have time to recharge and enjoy this season with those you love. Happy Holidays!
