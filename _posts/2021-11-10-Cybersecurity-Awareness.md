Federal agencies did it again! CIOs, CISOs, and their staff pulled together for another successful Cybersecurity Awareness Month. With this year’s overarching theme of “Do Your Part. #BeCyberSmart,” agency CIOs and CISOs did a great job educating, bringing awareness, and emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity. Here are just a few of the highlights from this year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month:


* The CISO Council featured four blogs on [CIO.gov]({{site.baseurl}}/programs-and-events/2021-cybersecurity-awareness-month/); a video message from [National Cyber Director Chris Inglis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJMVf78QtYs), and; an educational video on IT careers. 

* The Department of Education held virtual weekly events that included: Panels, presentations, and guest speakers (government and private sector).

* The Department of Energy held four cyber awareness webinars attracting over 250 attendees and posted cyber awareness educational tools that logged over 800 views.

* GSA conducted an external awareness campaign that included a session on “Your Critical Role in Cybersecurity” and kicked off a Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management Acquisition Community of Practice.

* NASA held nine webinar events during October themed around “Cybersecurity: Stronger Together.” 

* The Nuclear Regulatory Commission developed and offered an interactive escape room as a team-building exercise designed to educate teams on cybersecurity risks.

* Treasury conducted an enterprise-wide campaign and developed and hosted two informational sessions on ransomware— “What to know and how to avoid it,” and “A Technical dive for IT Professionals and Network Defenders.”

Congratulations to all of the Federal agencies that held events—we can’t wait to see what you have in store for next year’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month.
