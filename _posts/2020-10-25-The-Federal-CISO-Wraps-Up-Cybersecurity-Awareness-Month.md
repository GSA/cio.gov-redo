<p>This year has brought cybersecurity to the forefront of everyone&rsquo;s mind. As a community, we had to come together and found ourselves thrusted into focusing on challenges that were not only affecting our agencies, but our community as a whole. We pivoted to an increased telework environment - some of us were ready, while others had additional work to do. We, as a community, have made significant strides but our work isn&rsquo;t done.</p>
<p>Today, more than ever, data is part of everything we do. And because of this, it is key that data is protected. I am happy to report that agencies have made substantial progress in how they protect the publics the data. In addition, steps are being taken to close the gap on priority administration cybersecurity targets.</p>
<p>But as you know, our work isn&rsquo;t done. I challenge you to continue to think through the value, objectives, use cases and overall impact services, like cloud, have in supporting our capabilities to continue to serve the American public. It&rsquo;s important to remember that these services enable us to connect far more reliably and consistently than ever before. I ask that you keep that in mind when looking at other capabilities that can improve stability, sustainability, access, and of course &ndash; security.</p>
<p>Emerging technology continues to challenge how we do business &ndash; from the daily tasks to the big picture. <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is one of those capabilities that continue to transform how we do business in many similar ways to how cloud has impacted our day-to-day operations. These new emerging technologies bring exciting opportunity and with it, increased risk. Below are a few things we are working on to assist in shaping those ideas and ways we can implement AI safely, securely, and with the same impact that cloud continues to bring our workforce today.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is playing an active and focused role in driving conversations to strengthen and protect our Nation&rsquo;s AI efforts. That includes agency focused AI-related efforts needed to fulfill their missions by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Support: </strong>supporting and conducting AI research and development</li>
<li><strong>Standards Development: </strong>actively engaging in AI standards development</li>
<li><strong>Procurement &amp; Delivery: </strong>procuring and deploying standards-based products and services</li>
<li><strong>Policy &amp; Regulation: </strong>developing and implementing supportive policies, including regulatory policies where needed</li>
</ul>

<p>As the Federal CISO Council actively looks towards the future, I encourage you to take a moment and celebrate the achievements of this year. Please remain cyber-smart when working at home, on travel, or in the office.
