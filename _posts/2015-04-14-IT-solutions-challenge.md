The IT Solutions Challenge consists of several small working groups of rising stars within the IT and IT acquisition communities who will identify issues within the Federal Government and work together over the course of six months to develop solutions to those problems. The goal was to tap into the hands-on experiences of front lines and find innovative solutions based on their fresh perspectives.

The CIO Councilâ€™s Workforce Committee and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council recently requested Agencies nominate their best and brightest IT staff to participate in the first annual CIO Council IT Solutions Challenge. The Challenge is targeting IT and IT acquisition professionals in the GS-9 through GS-13 range who will be able to uncover and analyze policy and procedural problems within their Agencies or across the Federal Government. We are focusing on these rising stars because looking at problems from a new vantage point will allow important issues to surface that may not have been realized otherwise.

Teams work with mentors to assist in brainstorming sessions, problem identification, workplan development, and execution. Each team will also have access to subject matter experts who can provide feedback and expertise as they work to develop solutions. In the fall, teams will present their solutions and work with IT leaders to discuss next steps on implementing these solutions across the Federal Government.
