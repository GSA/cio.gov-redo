The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is leading a series of listening sessions to learn more from industry about their approaches to AI transparency and auditable risk management. Participants in this series include major large language model (LLM) developers as well as third party deployers who integrate LLMs into their products.

These sessions will inform OMB’s forthcoming guidance pursuant to [Executive Order 14319](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/07/28/2025-14217/preventing-woke-ai-in-the-federal-government), Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government. Topics discussed throughout the sessions include:

<ul>
  <li>The specific categories of risk that organizations monitor for;</li>
  <li>Pre-training criteria and methods to reduce identified risks as well as the post-training classifiers or similar rules that have been integrated;</li>
  <li>Continuous monitoring capabilities to detect unwanted model behavior and what documentation and intervention looks like;</li>
  <li>How organizations currently address the topics of ideological neutrality and truth-seeking, as presented in EO 14319;</li>
  <li>Whether any “instructions” are shared with a model when producing information about sensitive or political topics;</li>
  <li>Whether organizations have needed to update or alter any products to meet compliance with new state-level or national-level AI regulation. This would include alterations to: risk criteria, training approaches (to include data curation and model training methodologies), new classifiers, and new documentation requirements (e.g., via the EU’s AI Act); and</li>
  <li>Whether downstream integrators of AI models are satisfied with the level of transparency they receive from developers to meet regulatory reporting requirements.</li>
</ul>

If your organization has experience with any of these topics and wishes to participate in a listening session, please email EO14319Outreach@omb.eop.gov with the name and contact information of your organization and a short summary of the experiences or knowledge relevant to the topics above that your organization would like to share. Please note that participation is limited and OMB may be unable to accommodate all requests; however, OMB aims to obtain input from a reasonable range of industry representatives. Please be sure to submit interest before Friday, October 3rd, 2025.
