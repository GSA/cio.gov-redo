On September 19th, the Administration published updates to the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals and Agency Priority Goals (APGs) on [Performance.gov](https://www.performance.gov). These updates reflect the progress made between May and June 2019. As one of the IT Modernization Goal Leaders, I’m excited to announce that in alignment with the [IT Modernization Goal](https://trumpadministration.archives.performance.gov/CAP/it-mod/) and the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA)]({{ site.baseurl }}/policies-and-priorities/21st-century-IDEA-act/) we’ve re-launched CIO.gov leveraging common solutions and innovative practices to improve efficiency, increase security, and ultimately meet citizens’ needs.

**Data-Driven, Customer-Focused**

The first step to modernize CIO.gov was take a customer focused approach to the content and information architecture. Interviewing stakeholders, conducting user testing and looking at visitor data helped us determine what information users were looking for and how to approach design so that they could find it quickly and easily.

**Shared IT Services**

CIO.gov leverages many federally available tools. Prior to the re-design, this website transitioned to the [Federalist Publishing Platform](https://federalist.18f.gov/) to  take advantage of the commercial solutions offered though [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov), ensuring that it’s [FISMA compliant]({{ site.baseurl }}/policies-and-priorities/FISMA/). Using the Federalist platform also created continuity across other federal websites such as [FedRamp.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov), [Vote.gov](https://vote.gov), and [Performance.gov](https://www.performance.gov) indicating to the customer, along with its .gov domain, that CIO.gov is an official government website. Other tools used include:

* [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) - provides design guidelines and code to help agencies quickly create trustworthy, accessible, and consistent digital government services.
* [Search.gov](https://search.gov) - an open-source application that’s available to agencies across the US federal government to power the on site search boxes.
* [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov) trusted tester program and other artifacts - a site dedicated to helping government IT managers make IT accessible and user centered.
* [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/services/dap/) - offers advanced, easy Web analytics to federal agencies as a hosted shared service.

**Enhancing Engagement**

Finally, we’ve made it easier for interested parties to stay involved. Now you can:

* Look at our [Policy Catalog]({{ site.baseurl }}/policies-and-priorities/) to see what’s open for comment, in revision, in development, and active in the IT policy space
* [Browse resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/)
* [Sign up for the CIO Council bi-weekly newsletter](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?topic_id=USGSA_715)
* [Register for upcoming Council events]({{ site.baseurl }}/programs-and-events/)
