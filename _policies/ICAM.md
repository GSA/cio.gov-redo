**Title:** [Identity, Credentialing, and Access Management (ICAM)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of May 2019

**Description:** Advances in technology have enabled more digital interactions and business transactions, offering the Federal Government an opportunity for faster, more reliable connections and operations. In conjunction with this opportunity, however, a new set of challenges has emerged, because information about individuals has become more widely available through social media and breaches of personally identifiable information (PII). In favor of this opportunity, the Federal Government continues to refresh its digital infrastructure through comprehensive efforts focused on cybersecurity, procurement, and management of a workforce capable of operating modem, frequently cloud-based environments. To address the challenges that have emerged alongside this opportunity, embedded within these efforts is an intensified focus on risk management and the adoption of processes, policies, and solutions that enhance privacy and security and that mitigate the degradation of operational service delivery. Accordingly, identity management has become even more critical to the Federal Government's successful delivery of mission and business promises to the American public. As such, through this Federal ICAM policy, the Government is enacting a common vision for identity as an enabler of mission delivery, trust, and safety of the Nation.

To ensure secure and efficient operations, agencies of the Federal Government must be able to identify, credential, monitor, and manage subjects that access Federal resources, including information, information systems, facilities, and secured areas across their respective enterprises. In particular, how agencies conduct identity proofing, establish enterprise digital identities, and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control significantly affects the security and delivery of their services, as well as individuals' privacy. Furthermore, in line with the Federal Government's updated approach to modernization, it is essential that agencies' ICAM strategies and solutions shift from the obsolete Levels of Assurance (LOA) model towards a new model informed by risk management perspectives, the Federal resource accessed, and outcomes aligned to agency missions. To set the foundation for identity management and its usage to access physical and digital resources, agencies must implement National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63-3 and any successive versions (hereafter referred to as NIST SP 800-63). While NIST SP 800-63 is the foundation for digital identity, agencies must use it in combination with the remaining suite of publications that relate to identity management issued byNIST, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Department of Homeland Security(DHS) to form a comprehensive approach to identity proofing that safeguards privacy and security.
