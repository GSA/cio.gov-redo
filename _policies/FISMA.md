## Policy Summary

**Title:** [Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/M-19-02.pdf)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of 2002

**Description:** FISMA requires agencies to report the status of their information security programs to 0MB and requires Inspectors General (IG) to conduct annual independent assessments of those programs. 0MB and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborate with interagency partners to develop the Chief Information Officer (CIO) FISMA metrics, and with IG partners to develop the IG FISMA metrics to facilitate these processes. 0MB also works with the Federal privacy community to develop Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) metrics. These three sets of metrics together provide a more comprehensive picture of an agencyâ€™s cybersecurity performance.
