## Policy Summary

**Title:** [Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-americas-cybersecurity-workforce/)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of May 2019

**Description:** America’s cybersecurity workforce is a strategic asset that protects the American people, the homeland, and the American way of life.  The National Cyber Strategy, the President’s 2018 Management Agenda, and Executive Order 13800 of May 11, 2017 (Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure), each emphasize that a superior cybersecurity workforce will promote American prosperity and preserve peace.  America’s cybersecurity workforce is a diverse group of practitioners who govern, design, defend, analyze, administer, operate, and maintain the data, systems, and networks on which our economy and way of life depend.  Whether they are employed in the public or private sectors, they are guardians of our national and economic security.

The United States Government must enhance the workforce mobility of America’s cybersecurity practitioners to improve America’s national cybersecurity.  During their careers, America’s cybersecurity practitioners will serve in various roles for multiple and diverse entities.  United States Government policy must facilitate the seamless movement of cybersecurity practitioners between the public and private sectors, maximizing the contributions made by their diverse skills, experiences, and talents to our Nation.

The United States Government must support the development of cybersecurity skills and encourage ever-greater excellence so that America can maintain its competitive edge in cybersecurity.  The United States Government must also recognize and reward the country’s highest-performing cybersecurity practitioners and teams.

The United States Government must create the organizational and technological tools required to maximize the cybersecurity talents and capabilities of American workers –-especially when those talents and capabilities can advance our national and economic security.  The Nation is experiencing a shortage of cybersecurity talent and capability, and innovative approaches are required to improve access to training that maximizes individuals’ cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and abilities.  Training opportunities, such as work-based learning, apprenticeships, and blended learning approaches, must be enhanced for both new workforce entrants and those who are advanced in their careers.

In accordance with Executive Order 13800, the President will continue to hold heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) accountable for managing cybersecurity risk to their enterprises, which includes ensuring the effectiveness of their cybersecurity workforces.
