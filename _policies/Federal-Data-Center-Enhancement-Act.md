## Federal Data Center Enhancement Act ##

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released Memorandum [M-25-03](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/M-25-03_Implementation-Guidance-for-the-Federal-Data-Center-Enhancement-Act.pdf) to fulfill requirements of the Federal Data Center Enhancement Act (FDCEA) of 2023. OMB’s policy sets baseline requirements and best practices for Federal agencies’ management of data centers to ensure their reliability and resiliency. FDCEA provisions and M-25-03 sunset on September 30, 2026.
FDCEA replaced prior approaches to data center oversight. Previously the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) established now-expired provisions on data center consolidation and optimization, which were implemented through OMB’s Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI). Congress did not renew the prior provisions focused on data center optimization, and instead enacted the FDCEA, which directed OMB to set requirements for data centers to meet appropriate standards for cybersecurity, resiliency, and availability.
