## Policy Overview ##
Technology Business Management (TBM) is an IT management framework that implements a standard IT spend taxonomy. In other words, it implements a standard way to categorize IT costs, technologies, resources, applications and services. TBM enables organizations to disaggregate IT spending into smaller, consistent categories to provide CIOs and other C-suite executives with a more accurate and detailed understanding of their organization’s IT costs. This allows agencies to identify duplicative or unnecessary spending and to make better informed decisions regarding future investments.

## Why This Matters to the CIO Council ##
TBM is a powerful tool to further enable [Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA)]({{site.baseurl}}/policies-and-priorities/FITARA/) implementation and help benchmark IT spending, improve acquisitions, and better understand IT investment costs – and how those investments help agencies achieve their missions. As the effort matures and becomes more engrained in agencies, TBM will enable IT to run like a business by connecting technology to business value, building partnerships between IT and mission teams throughout agencies, and breaking down data silos across organizations. TBM will ultimately empower agency CIOs to better understand and communicate the business and mission value of IT spending to senior executives, mission support offices, and program managers.
