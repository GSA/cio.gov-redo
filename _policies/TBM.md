## Policy Summary

**Title:** [Technology Business Management]()<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of December 2014

**Description:** Technology Business Management (TBM) is an IT management framework that implements a standard IT spend taxonomy. TBM enables organizations to disaggregate IT spending into smaller, consistent categories to provide CIOs and other C-suite executives with a more accurate and detailed understanding of their organization’s IT costs. This allows CIOs to identify duplicative or unnecessary spending and to make better informed decisions regarding future investments.
