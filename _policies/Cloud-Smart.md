# Policy Overview #
As of June 2019, the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy — [Cloud Smart](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) — is a long-term, high-level strategy to drive cloud adoption in Federal agencies. This was the first cloud policy update in seven years, offering a path forward for agencies to migrate to a safe and secure cloud infrastructure. This strategyn supports agencies to achieve additional savings, security, and faster services.

Cloud Smart is founded on three key pillars of successful cloud adoption: security, procurement, and workforce. Collectively, these elements embody the interdisciplinary approach to IT modernization that the Federal enterprise needs in order to provide improved return on its investments, enhanced security, and higher quality services to the American people.
