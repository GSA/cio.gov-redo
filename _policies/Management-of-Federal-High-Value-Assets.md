# Policy Overview #

**Title:** [Management of High Value Assets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/M-19-03.pdf)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of December 2018

With the creation of the High Value Asset (HVA) initiative in 2015, the Federal Government’s CFO Act agencies took a pivotal step toward the identification of its most critical assets. DHS, in coordination with OMB, established a capability to assess agency HVAs, resulting in the identification of critical areas of weakness and plans to remediate those areas of weakness.

With the dynamic adversarial threat to the security and resilience of HVAs, it is essential that the initiative evolve to take a more comprehensive view of the risk to the Federal enterprise and the measures available to mitigate those risks. As such, the HVA program is expanding to support all agencies, including both CFO Act and non-CFO Act agencies, in HVA identification, assessment, remediation, and response to incidents.

As the HVA program3 matures, the Federal Government will bolster its vigilant protection of HVAs and meet the objectives of Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure to improve risk management across the executive branch.
