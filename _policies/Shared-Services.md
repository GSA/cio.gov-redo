## Policy Summary

**Title:** [Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M-19-16.pdf)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of April 2019

**Description:** This memorandum is a strategy based on industry experiences, and lessons learned from
other central governments that will reduce duplication, improve accountability, and improve
Federal shared services. This updated strategy will enable the delivery of an innovative, flexible,
and competitive set of solutions and services.

To oversee implementation of this strategy will require strong government-wide governance.
Over-time, the SSGB, QSMOs, and customer agencies will continually refresh the Governmentâ€™s
shared services strategy to improve service delivery and performance, enhance customer
satisfaction, and reduce costs6 to agency customers. Immediate implementation of this strategy
requires the Government to define and execute an integrated approach to shared services
including:

1. Developing inter-agency standards and priorities for shared services;
2. Creating centralized capabilities, shared governance, and performance expectations; and
3. Continuing to expedite the adoption of existing quality services that currently perform
well and provide demonstrated value to agency customers.
