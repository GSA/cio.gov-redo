## Policy Overview ##
The [Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/M-19-16.pdf) memorandum, as of April 2019, is a strategy based on industry experiences and lessons learned from other central governments. Its goal is to reduce duplication, improve accountability, and improve Federal shared services. This updated strategy enables the delivery of an innovative, flexible, and competitive set of solutions and services.

Overseeing implementation of this strategy requires strong government-wide governance. Over time, the Shared Solutions Governance Board, Quality Service Management Offices, and customer agencies will continually refresh the Governmentâ€™s shared services strategy to improve service delivery and performance, enhance customer satisfaction, and reduce costs to agency customers. Immediate implementation of this strategy requires the Government to define and execute an integrated approach to shared services, including:

1. Developing inter-agency standards and priorities for shared services;
2. Creating centralized capabilities, shared governance, and performance expectations; and
3. Continuing to expedite the adoption of existing quality services that currently perform
well and provide demonstrated value to agency customers.
