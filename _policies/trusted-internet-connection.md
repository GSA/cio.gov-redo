## Policy Overview ##
The purpose of the [Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf ) is to enhance network security across the Federal Government. Initially, this was done through the consolidation of external connections and the deployment of common tools at these access points. While this prior work has been invaluable in securing Federal networks and information, the program must adapt to modem architectures and frameworks for government IT resource utilization. Accordingly, [M-19-26]( https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf ) provides an enhanced approach for implementing the TIC initiative that provides agencies with increased flexibility to use modern security capabilities. This memorandum also establishes a process for ensuring the TIC initiative is agile and responsive to advancements in technology and rapidly evolving threats.
