# Policy Overview #
The term "cloud" is a technology solution that exhibit five essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Cloud solutions include "on-demand service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service."

As of June 2019, the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy — [Cloud Smart](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) — is a long-term, high-level strategy to drive cloud adoption in Federal agencies. This was the first cloud policy update in seven years, offering a path forward for agencies to migrate to a safe and secure cloud infrastructure. This strategy supports agencies to achieve additional savings, security, and faster services.

Cloud Smart is founded on three key pillars of successful cloud adoption: security, procurement, and workforce. Collectively, these elements embody the interdisciplinary approach to IT modernization that the Federal enterprise needs in order to provide improved return on its investments, enhanced security, and higher quality services to the American people.

# Why This Matters to the CIO Council #
The case for using cloud capabilities in government has been clearly proven – to drive savings, to improve security, and to deliver mission-serving solutions faster.

The Federal Government’s responsibility is to achieve the benefits of cloud computing as quickly as possible. Any inefficiencies negatively impact its ability to serve the American public. Cloud computing has the potential to play a major part in addressing these inefficiencies and improving government service delivery.
