# Policy Overview #

**Title:** [Technology Modernization Fund (TMF)](https://tmf.cio.gov/)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of 2017

**Description:** The Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) was authorized by the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017.

Approved projects receive incremental funding and technical expertise to ensure project success. The TMF received $100 million in FY 2018 to fund modernization projects, and another $25 million in FY 2019. The Presidentâ€™s FY 2020 Budget requests an additional $150 million.

### How the TMF works
The TMF is overseen by the Technology Modernization Board, comprised of Government IT leaders representing proven expertise in technology, transformation, and operations. Agencies submit IT-related project proposals for the Board to review and consider. Agencies submit technology modernization proposals to the Board through a two-phased approval process.

**Phase One: Initial Project Proposal (IPP)**:
Agencies submit Initial Project Proposals (IPPs), which act as a low burden pre-screen to maximize the number of unique projects the Board can review. Agencies must also confirm that funding for this project has never explicitly been denied or restricted by Congress.

**Phase Two: Full Project Proposal (FPP)**:
If the Board approves an IPP, the project team submits their Full Project Proposal (FPP) to the Board. The FPP entails a more comprehensive description of the proposal, discrete project milestones, and funding schedule. The team will also prepare a pitch deck and in-person presentation for the Board.

Projects recommended for funding by the Board receive incremental funding contingent on the successful execution of milestones. The TMF provides greater flexibility to agencies funding technology modernization efforts by extended payback requirements to five years.

Proposal templates for the IPP and FPP phases are available in the Documents & Templates section of this site.
