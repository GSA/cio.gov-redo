## Policy Overview ##
The [Technology Modernization Fund (TMF)](https://tmf.cio.gov/) was authorized by the Modernizing Government Technology Act of 2017. The TMF is an innovative funding vehicle that gives agencies additional ways to deliver services to the American public more quickly, better secure sensitive systems and data, and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently.

The TMF is overseen by the Technology Modernization Board, comprised of Government IT leaders representing proven expertise in technology, transformation, and operations. Agencies submit IT-related project proposals for the Board to review and consider. To receive funding from the TMF, federal agencies may submit technology modernization proposals to the Board through a two-phased approval process. Proposal templates for the Initial Project Proposal and Full Project Proposal phases are available in Related Resources.
