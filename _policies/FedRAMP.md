## Policy Overview ##
The [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/) is a government-wide program, as of December 2018, that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP created and manages a core set of processes to ensure effective, repeatable cloud security for the government. It also established a mature marketplace to increase utilization and familiarity with cloud services while facilitating collaboration across government through open exchanges of lessons learned, use cases, and tactical solutions.

## Why This Matters to the CIO Council ##
By adopting innovative cloud services to meet their critical mission needs, agencies have the opportunity to save both time and money. FedRAMP enables agencies to rapidly adapt from old, insecure legacy IT to mission-enabling, secure, and cost effective cloud-based IT.
