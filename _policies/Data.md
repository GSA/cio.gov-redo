## Policy Overview ##
The use of data is transforming society, business, and the economy. Data provided by the Federal Government have a unique place in society and maintaining trust in Federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. The Federal Government needs a robust, integrated approach to using data to deliver on mission, serve customers, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality.

The [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/) consists of Principles and Practices to leverage the value of the entire Federal Government data asset portfolio while protecting security, privacy, and confidentiality. Defined in memorandum [M-19-18](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/M-19-18.pdf) in June 2019, the principles and practices deliver a more consistent approach to federal data stewardship, use, and access.

The four areas of Federal Data Strategy are:
- Enterprise Data Governance,
- Access, Use, and Augmentation,
- Decision Making & Accountability, and
- Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.

## Why This Matters to the CIO Council ##
The Administration is focused on [Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://trumpadministration.archives.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/). The Council is a key strategic partner in leveraging the value of federal data for mission, service, and the public good by guiding the Federal Government in practicing ethical governance, conscious design, and a learning culture. We support the effort to build a "long-term, enterprise-wide Federal Data Strategy to:

- Better govern and leverage the Federal Governmentâ€™s data;
- Enable government data to be accessible and useful for the American public, businesses, and researchers; and
- Improve the use of data for decision-making and accountability for the Federal Government, including for policy-making, innovation, oversight, and learning."
