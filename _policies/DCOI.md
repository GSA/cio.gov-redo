# Priority Overview #

**Title:** [Data Center Optimization Initiative](https://datacenters.cio.gov/)<br>
**Publication/Active Date:** As of August 2016

**Description:** The Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) established in OMB Memorandum M-19-19 supercedes the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) and fulfills the data center requirements of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). M-19-19 rescinds and replaces M-16-19 Data Center Optimization Initiative.

The DCOI requires agencies to develop and report on data center strategies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize existing facilities, improve security posture, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure, such as cloud services and inter-agency shared services
