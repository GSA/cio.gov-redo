# Priority Overview #
The [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/) consists of Principles and Practices to leverage the value of the entire Federal Government data asset portfolio while protecting security, privacy, and confidentiality. Defined in memorandum [M-19-18](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/M-19-18.pdf), the principles and practices deliver a more consistent approach to federal data stewardship, use, and access. The principles are a timeless, enduring framework for agencies, while the practices are actionable, yet aspirational, goals for a 5- to 10-year time horizon.

**The four areas of Federal Data Strategy**

**Enterprise Data Governance:**
Set priorities for managing government data as a strategic asset, including establishing data policies, specifying roles and responsibilities for data privacy, security, and confidentiality protection, and monitoring compliance with standards and policies throughout the information lifecycle.

**Access, Use, and Augmentation:**
Develop policies and procedures that enable stakeholders to effectively and efficiently access and use data assets by: (1) making data available more quickly and in more useful formats; (2) maximizing the amount of non-sensitive data shared with the public; (3) leveraging new technologies and best practices to increase access to sensitive or restricted data while protecting privacy, security, and confidentiality, as well as the interests of data providers.

**Decision Making & Accountability:**
Improve the use of data assets for decision-making and accountability for the Federal Government, including both internal and external uses. This includes: (1) providing high quality and timely information to inform evidence-based decision-making and learning; (2) facilitating external research on the effectiveness of government programs and policies which will inform future policymaking; and (3) fostering public accountability and transparency by providing accurate and timely spending information, performance metrics, and other administrative data.

**Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use:**
Facilitate the use of Federal Government data assets by external stakeholders at the forefront of making government data accessible and useful through commercial ventures, innovation, or for other public uses. This includes use by the private sector and scientific and research communities, by state and local governments for public policy purposes, for education, and in enabling civic engagement. Enabling external users to access and use government data for commercial and other public purposes spurs innovative technological solutions and fills gaps in government capacity and knowledge. Supporting the production and dissemination of comprehensive, accurate, and objective statistics on the state of the nation helps businesses and markets operate more efficiently.
