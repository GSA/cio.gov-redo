## Policy Overview ##
The Federal Government needs an IT workforce that can effectively carry out its mission. "Workforce" is a push toward identifying, hiring, and empowering the best possible people in federal IT. The Administration's broader focus on [Developing the Workforce of the 21st Century](https://trumpadministration.archives.performance.gov/CAP/workforce/) aims to "achieve a state where Federal agencies and managers can hire the best employees, remove the worst employees, and engage employees at all levels of the organization. The Government must put a framework in place that drives and encourages strategic human capital management."

## Why This Matters to the CIO Council ##
The Council is committed to its strategic goal of providing the Federal Government with a workforce of highly capable IT professionals with mission critical competencies to meet agency goals.

Our [Workforce Committee]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/members-and-leadership/workforce-committee/) focuses on the full employment life cycle: workforce planning, recruitment, retention, and career development. We work with the [Federal Chief Human Capital Officers](https://chcoc.gov/) and broader HR community to develop, implement, and communicate strategies to recruit, retain, and manage a fully trained and qualified tech and cybersecurity workforce, to better meet current and future mission requirements.
