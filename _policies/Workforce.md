# Priority Overview #
The Federal Government needs an IT workforce that can effectively carry out its mission. "Workforce" is a push toward identifying, hiring, and empowering the best possible people in federal IT. The Administration's broader focus on [Developing the Workforce of the 21st Century](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/workforce/) aims to "achieve a state where Federal agencies and managers can hire the best employees, remove the worst employees, and engage employees at all levels of the organization. The Government must put a framework in place that drives and encourages strategic human capital management."

# Why This Matters to the CIO Council #
The Council is committed to its strategic goal of providing the Federal Government with a workforce of highly capable IT professionals with mission critical competencies to meet agency goals.

Our [Workforce Committee]({{ site.baseurl }}//members-and-leadership/workforce-committee/) focuses on the full employment life cycle: workforce planning, recruitment, retention, and career development. We work with the HR community to develop, implement and communicate strategies to recruit, retain and manage a fully trained and qualified IT workforce, to meet current and future mission requirements.
