## Policy Overview ##
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (or OPEN Government Data Act, Pub.L. 115â€“435) is a United States law that requires the federal government to modernize its data management practices.

The bill requires agencies to submit annually to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress a systematic plan for identifying and addressing policy questions. The plan must include, among other things:

* Questions for developing evidence to support policymaking;
* Data the agency intends to collect, use, or acquire to facilitate the use of evidence in policymaking;
* Methods and analytical approaches that may be used to develop evidence to support policymaking; and
* Challenges to developing evidence to support policymaking, including any statutory or other restrictions to accessing relevant data.
* Each agency shall designate a senior employee as Evaluation Officer to coordinate evidence-building activities and an official with statistical expertise to advise on statistical policy, techniques, and procedures.
