COPY THIS MARKDOWN (MD) FILE INTO THE POST FOLDER ABOVE. Then use this as the template. Always name the permalink and the file with the date first. 

# This is a Header at level 1. It's pretty large.
This is text. No need for a space between the header and text because it is automatic.

## This is a Header at level 2. It's large but not huge.
This is text. No need for a space between the header and text because it is automatic.

### This is a Header at level 3. Notice that when you add a hashtag it determines the level.
This is text. No need for a space between the header and text because it is automatic.

# Here we go again with a top Header at level 1
This is text. No need for a space between the header and text because it is automatic.

This is how you do a bulleted list in markdown:
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

And this is how you write a link [Link words that show in the text](https://URLhere.com) and some text after for good measure.

*This is text in italics.*
**This is text in bold.**
