## The Vision
Held every October, National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) is a collaborative effort between government and industry to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to ensure that all Americans have the resources they need to be safer and more secure online. Our vision is to spread awareness to federal employees around cyber specific topics and promote events across the federal landscape related to NCSAM.

## The Program
Held throughout the month of October, CIO.gov will post information related to the "new work environment" themes:
- Be Cyber Smart;
- Fight the Phish;
- Career Awareness Week; and
- Cybersecurity First.

We will feature blog posts from CISO Council leadership, short video blogs, and social media posts.
