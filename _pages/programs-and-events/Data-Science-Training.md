The CIO Council is pleased to announce the launch of the Data Science Training Program. In support of the President’s Management Agenda and the Federal Data Strategy, the Data Science Training Program pilot upskills the Federal workforce to tackle problems of unique importance to the Federal government. Agencies will select a diverse group of high performing and high potential employees who will learn and apply data science techniques to enhance data gathering, analysis and data visualization-enriched presentations, yielding informed, data driven decisions. This pilot trains 60 Federal employees, requiring a commitment of 8 hours of training per week and culminates with a Capstone Project identified by each Agency. There are no upfront costs to agencies, although each participating Agency is responsible for providing access to required tools (e.g., programming, data visualization, etc.). The training slots are available to the 24 CFO Act agencies. Coordination is taking place with CIO offices.

The 24 CFO Act Agency CIO offices will coordinate with OMB’s Office of the Federal CIO to nominate their participants. Agencies are encouraged to attend an upcoming information session to learn more about the program and ask follow-up questions.

**When**: Announcement and nomination process began in July 2020 and the training program runs through April 2021.

**Where**: This is an online training program. Agencies may consider participants from the entire Federal workforce.

**Who**: This training program targets existing Federal employees that may benefit from data science skills to gain efficiencies in their respective duties.
