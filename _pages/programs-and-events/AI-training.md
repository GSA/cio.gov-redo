We wanted to let you know of an upcoming free virtual [AI Training Program](https://gsa.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_g8EC80ddR2OsLJnE7HS_IQ) available to all Federal employees <u>from September 18 through September 28</u>.  The training program is sponsored by the [General Services Administration AI Community of Practice](https://coe.gsa.gov/communities/ai.html) and the [Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI)](https://hai.stanford.edu/). GSA will be promoting the training this week. Please help spread the word and share with your agencies too.  

The below training is designed to educate the federal workforce on the basics of AI:
1. Monday, September 18 (12-1pm ET): Navigating the AI Landscape: Fundamentals of the Science and Technology \| Speaker: [Peter Norvig](https://profiles.stanford.edu/peter-norvig)
2. Thursday, September 21 (12-1pm ET): Understanding Foundation Models: Opportunities and Challenges \| Speaker: [Rishi Bommasani](https://rishibommasani.github.io/)
3. Friday, September 22 (12-1pm ET): Mitigating Risk: Implementing Safe & Robust AI \| Speaker: [Anthony Corso](https://anthonylcorso.com/)
4. Tuesday, September 26 (12-1pm ET): Addressing bias and data privacy concerns in the Age of Algorithms \| Speaker: [Jen King](https://profiles.stanford.edu/194010?releaseVersion=7.5.5)
5. Wednesday, September 27 (12-1pm ET): Modernizing a Mammoth: Use-Cases of Public Sector AI \| Speaker: [Daniel E. Ho](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/daniel-e-ho/)

These sessions are intended to introduce concepts and theory around artificial intelligence (AI) to empower federal employees with awareness of the technical concepts underlying AI, including various algorithm structures in AI and the technical underpinnings of foundation models, as well as examples of risks that have occurred through the use of AI and techniques that AI developers can use to mitigate risk. Thus, per the requirements as laid out by the AI Training Act, attendees should expect the session content to include technical aspects of AI systems and theory.
