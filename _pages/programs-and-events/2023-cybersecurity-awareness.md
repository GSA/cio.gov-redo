<h2>Overview</h2>

Since 2004, the President of the United States and Congress have declared October Cybersecurity Awareness Month, helping citizens protect themselves online as our technology, and threats to that technology, become more sophisticated and interwoven in our daily lives.

This is the 20th Cybersecurity Awareness Month and it has grown into a collaborative effort between government and industry to enhance cybersecurity awareness, encourage actions by the public to reduce online risk and generate discussion on cyber threats on a national and global scale.

In recognition of the 20th year, CISA announced a new enduring cybersecurity awareness program, [Secure Our World](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world). Secure Our World reflects a new enduring message to be integrated across the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) awareness campaigns and programs, and encourages all of us to take action each day to protect ourselves when online or using connected devices.

The program promotes behavioral change across the Nation, with a particular focus on how individuals, families and small to medium-sized businesses can Secure Our World by focusing on the four critical actions below. 

*Secure Our World is the theme for this year's Cybersecurity Awareness Month and will remain the enduring theme for future awareness month campaigns.*
