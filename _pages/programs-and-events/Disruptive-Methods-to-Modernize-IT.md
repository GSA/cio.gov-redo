On November 7th, the Federal Government will celebrate the people, processes, and technologies underpinning agency mission. This all-day symposium intends to humanize the Federal IT Operating Plan priorities and illustrate the impact that these priorities have on public facing service, in addition to creating a collaborative forum for two-way dialogue across federal, state and local governments, academia, and the private sector focused on current and futuristic topics impacting agencies today. This event is co-hosted by the General Services Administration and the Department of Energy. Join us virtually or in person at the GSA headquarters. No badge required, escorts available.
