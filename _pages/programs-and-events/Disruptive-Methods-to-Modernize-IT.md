**The Purpose**

On November 7th, the Federal Government will celebrate the people, processes, and technologies underpinning agency missions. The all-day Symposium, "Disruptive Methods to Modernize IT" intends to humanize the Federal IT Operating Plan priorities and illustrate the impact that these priorities have on public facing service, in addition to creating a collaborative forum for two-way dialogue across federal, state, and local governments, academia, and the private sector focused on current and futuristic topics impacting agencies today.

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will host the Symposium at [1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC](https://www.google.com/maps/search/1800+F+Street+NW,+Washington,+DC?entry=gmail&source=g), from 8:00am - 4:00pm ET.
