**The Purpose**

In FY24, the Committee is delivering programming to humanize Federal IT Operating Plan priorities and illustrate the impact that these priorities have on public facing services. The Symposium Series creates a forum for two-way dialogue across federal, state and local governments, academia, and the private sector focused on current and futuristic topics impacting agencies today.  The government is bringing a challenge and opportunity to partner with industry and others to learn from one another on the impact of IT Modernization on supporting the public.
