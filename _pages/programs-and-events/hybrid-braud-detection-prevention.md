The Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council Innovation Committee accelerates the adoption of new practices, processes, and technologies in the U.S. Government.

The government is bringing a challenge and opportunity to partner with industry and others to learn from one another on current and futuristic topics impacting agencies today.
