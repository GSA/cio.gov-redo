## The Vision
Held every October, National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) is a collaborative effort between government and industry to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to ensure that all Americans have the resources they need to be safer and more secure online.

## The Program
Held throughout the month of October CIO.gov will post information related to the following themes:
- Mobile Device Security;
- Wi-fi Hot spots  and Traveling;
- Phishing; and
- Home Security for Teleworking.  

We will feature one-pagers for each theme authored by agencies, blog posts from CISO Council leadership, short video blogs, and various cybersecurity events hosted by agencies.
