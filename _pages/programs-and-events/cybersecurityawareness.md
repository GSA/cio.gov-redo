## The Vision
Held every October, National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) is a collaborative effort between government and industry to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to ensure that all Americans have the resources they need to be safer and more secure online. Our vision is to spread awareness to federal employees around cyber specific topics and promote events across the federal landscape related to NCSAM.

## The Program
Held throughout the month of October, CIO.gov will post information related to the "new work environment" themes:
- Personal Device Security;
- Securing the Home Network;
- Social Engineering; and
- Security in the age of Internet of Things (IoT).  

We will feature one-pagers for each theme authored by agencies, blog posts from CISO Council leadership, short video blogs, and various cybersecurity events hosted by agencies. Resources
