## The Vision
Held every October, National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) is a collaborative effort between government and industry to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to ensure that all Americans have the resources they need to be safer and more secure online. Our vision is to spread awareness to federal employees around cyber specific topics and promote events across the federal landscape related to NCSAM.

## The Program
Held throughout the month of October, CIO.gov will post information related to the "new work environment" themes:
- Personal Device Security;
- Securing the Home Network;
- Social Engineering; and
- Security in the age of Internet of Things (IoT).  

We will feature one-pagers for each theme authored by agencies, blog posts from CISO Council leadership, short video blogs, and various cybersecurity events hosted by agencies. Resources

Now, more than ever, we are learning that the line between our online and offline lives is dissolving.  With more of our lives taking place in a virtual world it’s critically important to protect your online connections!  Trustwave SpiderLabs will present an attack scenario that is played out daily across the globe and emulated by many Red Teams in order to help improve the security posture of organizations.  They will demonstrate why password hygiene is an important part of everyone’s cyber-security plan.  The demonstration will highlight how weak and previously compromised passwords used across organizational and personal accounts may lead to a full breach scenario.

**Time:** 12:00 p.m. - 1:00 p.m. EST  
**Location:** Everywhere! This event is 100% virtual via WebEx
