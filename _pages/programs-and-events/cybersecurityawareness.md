## The Vision
Held every October, National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM) is a collaborative effort between government and industry to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and to ensure that all Americans have the resources they need to be safer and more secure online. Our vision is to spread awareness to federal employees around cyber specific topics and promote events across the federal landscape related to NCSAM.

## The Program
Held throughout the month of October, CIO.gov will post information related to the "new work environment" themes:
- Personal Device Security;
- Securing the Home Network;
- Social Engineering; and
- Security in the age of Internet of Things (IoT).  

We will feature one-pagers for each theme authored by agencies, blog posts from CISO Council leadership, short video blogs, and various cybersecurity events hosted by agencies. Resources
- **Week of October 5th:** Kick-Off - Privacy, Access, and Authentication
- **Week of October 12th:** Network safety, Collaboration and Telework Best Practices
- **Week of October 19th:** Social Engineering
- **Week of October 26th:** Future of Connected Devices, The Internet of Things and Security

### [Business Email Compromise Cyber Range Challenge](https://dhsconnect.connectsolutions.com/r2-imr203/event/registration.html)

The Business Email Compromise Challenge is a six-hour, live-fire Cyber Range training exercise led by technical instructors and expert cybersecurity engineers.

This exercise is structured with the following scenario: Your organization receives an announcement that a successful phishing attack is suspected to have occurred. Participants will use tools on the host environment to investigate the intrusion and uncover evidence, submit a briefing, and discuss their findings.

- Ideal candidates for this course are beginner, intermediate, and expert incident response and cybersecurity analysts wishing to exercise their hands-on skills. The exercise assumes a mixed audience (e.g. from disparate teams and organizations) of mixed capability. Registrants are able to sign up as individuals, or can participate with specific teammates by providing a team name on the registration form.
- The bulk of the course requires active use of cyber defense and forensic tools including Squert, Kibana, and Cyber Chef to investigate a business email compromise. While experience with these tools is not necessary, prior hands-on experience working incident response is highly beneficial.

**Time:** 8:30 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. EDT  
**Location:** Online via Adobe Connect  
**Duration:** 7 hours (6-hour course with breaks)

Now, more than ever, we are learning that the line between our online and offline lives is dissolving.  With more of our lives taking place in a virtual world it’s critically important to protect your online connections!  Trustwave SpiderLabs will present an attack scenario that is played out daily across the globe and emulated by many Red Teams in order to help improve the security posture of organizations.  They will demonstrate why password hygiene is an important part of everyone’s cyber-security plan.  The demonstration will highlight how weak and previously compromised passwords used across organizational and personal accounts may lead to a full breach scenario.

**Time:** 12:00 p.m. - 1:00 p.m. EST  
**Location:** Everywhere! This event is 100% virtual via WebEx
