**Overview**

Since 2004, the President of the United States and Congress have declared October Cybersecurity Awareness Month, helping citizens protect themselves online as our technology, and threats to that technology, become more sophisticated and interwoven in our daily lives.

This year's campaign theme --- "See Yourself in Cyber" --- demonstrates that while cybersecurity may seem like a complex subject, ultimately, it's really all about people. This October will focus on the "people" part of cybersecurity, providing information and resources to help educate Federal employees and ensure all individuals and organizations make smart decisions whether on the job, at home or at school -- now and in the future.

For individuals and families, we encourage you to See Yourself taking action to stay safe online. That means enabling basic cyber hygiene practices: think before you click, update your software, have good strong passwords or a password keeper, and enable multi-factor authentication (meaning you need "More Than A Password!") on all your sensitive accounts. For those considering joining the cyber community, we encourage you to See Yourself joining the cyber workforce. 

For our partners in industry, we encourage you to See Yourself as part of the solution. That means putting operational collaboration into practice, working together to share information in real-time, and reducing risk and building resilience from the start to protect America's critical infrastructure and the systems that Americans rely on every day.

We'll be sharing blog posts, videos and more here, on our [blog](https://www.cio.gov/news/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ciodotgov) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/federal-cio-council/) feeds  -- be sure to give them a follow to stay up-to-date with the latest releases!
