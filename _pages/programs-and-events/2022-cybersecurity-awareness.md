<h2>Overview</h2>

Since 2004, the President of the United States and Congress have declared October Cybersecurity Awareness Month, helping citizens protect themselves online as our technology, and threats to that technology, become more sophisticated and interwoven in our daily lives.

This year's campaign theme --- "See Yourself in Cyber" --- demonstrates that while cybersecurity may seem like a complex subject, ultimately, it's really all about people. This October will focus on the "people" part of cybersecurity, providing information and resources to help educate Federal employees and ensure all individuals and organizations make smart decisions whether on the job, at home or at school -- now and in the future.

We'll be sharing blog posts, videos and more here, on our [blog](https://www.cio.gov/news/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ciodotgov) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/federal-cio-council/) feedsÂ  -- be sure to give them a follow to stay up-to-date with the latest releases!
