          Modernization Division. The C&I CoP is designed for federal IT
          practitioners who want to network with other agencies to learn about
          common cloud, infrastructure and IT challenges and best practices.

        <p><strong>IT Sustainability Subcommunity of Practice</strong></p>
        <p>
          A sustainable IT environment provides material benefit to federal
          agencies and taxpayers through reduced energy costs and improved
          resiliency of federal infrastructure. Estimated global IT-related
          greenhouse gas emissions range from 2.1% to 3.9% of total CO2
          emissions. Awareness is the first step in understanding the complex
          interplay between our technology and implementation decisions and our
          stewardship of the environment. The IT Sustainability Subcommunity of
          Practice (ITS Sub CoP) convenes quarterly to discuss fostering a
          sustainable environment within the federal government. Visit our team
