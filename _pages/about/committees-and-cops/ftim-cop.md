# About Our CoP
The Federal Technology Investment Management (FTIM) Community of Practice (CoP) is a chartered group under the federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council [E-Ops (formerly SSI) Committee](https://www.cio.gov/about/members-and-leadership/e-ops/). It represents the combination of the former Technology Business Management (TBM) CoP and Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) CoP.  It comprises a cross-agency community of federal partners that:
- Provide feedback to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OFCIO); and
- Mature the integration of Technology Business Management (TBM),  IT Capital Planning, and IT Investment Control (CPIC) and portfolio management practices in the federal government through the sharing of best practices and lessons learned.
