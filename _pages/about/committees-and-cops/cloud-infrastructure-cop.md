# About Our CoP
The Cloud & Infrastructure Community of Practice (C&I CoP) provides both in-person and virtual forums for agencies to share and learn about Federal IT infrastructure. Discussion topics include cloud adoption, new technologies, best practices, common challenges, and more. The C&I CoP facilitates information sharing among federal agencies to speed cloud migration and data center consolidation.

# How to Participate
## Attend Meetings
The C&I CoP meets the first Wednesday afternoon of each month at GSA in Washington, DC. These meetings provide agencies with an opportunity to ask questions and share insights with IT infrastructure colleagues. Participants can attend either in-person or virtually. Email [dcoi@gsa.gov](mailto:dcoi@gsa.gov) to submit agenda items or suggest topics for future meetings.

## Participate in Working Groups
C&I CoP members can join working groups to participate in in-depth discussions and research on federal IT. Working group members collaboratively develop solutions such as white papers, and share with the wider C&I CoP for consideration. Email [dcoi@gsa.gov](mailto:dcoi@gsa.gov) to learn more about joining these working groups.

## Application Rationalization Playbook
The [Playbook]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/files/Application-Rationalization-Playbook.pdf) is a practical guide for application rationalization and IT portfolio management under Cloud Smart. It helps Portfolio Managers think through their agency’s approach to IT modernization. It also addresses challenges and opportunities for IT leaders, managers, and technical practitioners, and offers suggestions on how to overcome barriers to success. Each agency should tailor it to fit their unique needs. Application rationalization will ultimately help federal agencies mature IT portfolio management capabilities, empower leaders to make informed decisions, and improve the delivery of key mission and business services.

The Application [Rationalization Example Questionnaire Template](/assets/files/Rationalization Example Questionnaire Template.xlsx) is a supplemental tool for the Application Rationalization Playbook. Agencies should feel free to use this template and modify as they see fit to best prepare to initiate an application rationalization process. The Template is not designed to be an exhaustive questionnaire, but agencies can use the template as a starting point.
