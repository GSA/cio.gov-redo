                <p>The IT Modernization Division, within GSA’s Office of Government-wide Policy Office of Technology Policy, provides CFO Act agencies with support and guidance for cloud strategy, datacenter optimization and modernizing their technology stack.

                    <li>Manage various subcommunities of practice, including the Agile, IPv6, IT Sustainability, Low Code No Code and Workforce Development subcommunities.

                    <li>Publish educational artifacts on topics such as application rationalization, containerization, cloud operations, and zero trust.</li>
                </ul>
