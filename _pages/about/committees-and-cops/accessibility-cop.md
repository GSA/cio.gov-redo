# About Our CoP

The Accessibility Community of Practice is the principal interagency forum to support accessibility of information technology (IT) products and services in the Federal government. [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title29/html/USCODE-2011-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm) requires Federal agencies to ensure all IT products and services that they buy, build, maintain, or use, accessible to people with disabilities.

The U.S. Access Board is responsible for developing accessibility standards that Federal agencies must apply to Federal IT development and procurement. The [Revised 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines) were updated in January 2018, and apply to things such as computers, telecommunications equipment, printers, software, websites, information kiosks, and electronic documents.

Review the [Executive Guide to IT Accessibility](https://section508.gov/tools/playbooks/exec-guide-accessibility) to learn more. (The Executive Guide is also [available as a PDF](https://section508.gov/sites/default/files/Executive%20Guide%20to%20Federal%20IT%20Accessibility.pdf#overlay-context=tools/playbooks).)
