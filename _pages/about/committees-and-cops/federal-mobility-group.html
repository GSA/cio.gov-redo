<p>The FMG is chartered under the Federal Chief Information Security Council and works across the federal government to identify common mobility challenges, develop workable solutions and create opportunities to share best practices. As Federal Agencies become increasingly reliant on using wireless and mobility solutions to meet their mission, it becomes increasingly important for Federal Agencies to collaborate with each other to leverage their successful and proven solutions.</p>
<p>The FMG was born out of the consolidation of the Mobile Services Category Team (MSCT) and the Mobile Technology Tiger Team (MTTT). Comprised of mobility subject matter experts (SMEs) from Departments and Agencies across the Federal Government, the MSCT and MTTT had been partnering for nearly two years to address common mobility challenges prior to the formation of the FMG. Consolidating the two groups crystalized the partnership, which now positions the FMG to respond to the evolving definition of mobility and emerging technologies that comprise the mobility landscape. The FMG provides a singular conduit for the federal mobile community, whose purpose is to share information and identify cross-agency needs for mobile policy, guidance and best practices, acquisition of mobile devices and services, and operational requirements for federal mobility programs.</p>
<p>The FMG is co-chaired by mobile leaders from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The FMG reports to the Federal CIO Council, with executive sponsorship by a Federal Agency Senior Executive. To ensure the FMG appropriately considers acquisition policy and priorities set by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the FMG has a matrixed reporting relationship to the Federal IT Category Manager.&nbsp;</p>
