Technology enables the Government to deliver on its mission. We need technologists at the table collaborating with our Nation's leaders and providing expertise on how best to launch products and services that are secure by design, digital by default.

Working together, we can deliver better digital experiences to over 400 million people counting on us.

We have a mandate. **All we need is you.** 

**We the people means us, you and me** -- we are the mission-critical drivers for this change. There's no one else coming. It's up to us. 

If you're interested in becoming part of the solution -- as an early, mid, or senior career technologist -- I welcome you to visit the sites below. There are many entry points to a career in the Federal Government and when in doubt USAJobs is our government "job board". However we also have many more entry points based on your career level. While the list below is not exhaustive, we've curated several opportunities that may provide a "front door" into government.   

There's a place for everyone. We look forward to you joining us -- you'll never be the same again!
