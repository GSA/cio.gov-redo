# What is Data? #
The use of data is transforming society, business, and the economy. Data provided by the Federal Government have a unique place in society and maintaining trust in Federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. The Federal Government needs a robust, integrated approach to using data to deliver on mission, serve customers, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality.

# Why This Matters to the CIO Council #
Thee Administration is focused on [Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/), as so are we. We're supporting this push to build a "long-term, enterprise-wide Federal Data Strategy to:
- better govern and leverage the Federal Governmentâ€™s data;
- enable government data to be accessible and useful for the American public, businesses, and researchers; and
- improve the use of data for decision-making and accountability for the Federal Government, including for policy-making, innovation, oversight, and learning."
