# What is Cybersecurity? #
Our Nation's security and economic prosperity depend on the stability and integrity of our Federal communications and information infrastructure. Threats to cyberspace pose some of the most serious challenges of the 21st century for the United States. (Examples or plain language description?)

# Why This Matters to the CIO Council #
In order to address the threats posed on our nationâ€™s cybersecurity defenses, the Federal Government must continue to advance technical and policy protection capabilities for national systems. We must also expand partnerships with the private sector and work with Congress to clarify roles and responsibilities.
