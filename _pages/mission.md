Originally established by Executive Order 13011 (Federal Information Technology) and later codified by the E-Government Act of 2002, the CIO Council is the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to the design, acquisition, development, modernization, use, sharing, and performance of Federal information resources.

The CIO Council is one element of an interagency support structure established to achieve information resource management objectives delineated in legislation including the E-Government Act of 2002, Government Paperwork Elimination Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, Government Performance and Results Act, and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996.

## Mission Statement

The U.S. CIO supports goals of greater transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in Federal Government through the use of innovative IT strategies. The U.S. CIO works to ensure information security, protect individual privacy, and save taxpayer dollars by creating a Federal Government that strategically, efficiently, and effectively uses IT to serve and protect U.S. citizens.

### Governing Principles

The U.S. CIO and the CIO Council establish standards against which the success of all agency programs can be measured, including:

* monitoring the year-to-year performance improvement of Federal Government programs
* attracting and retaining a high-performance IT workforce
* optimizing Federal Government information resources and investments
* aligning IT solutions with Federal enterprise business processes
* adopting and sharing best IT management practices
* managing risk and ensuring privacy and security
