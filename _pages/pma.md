# What is the PMA? #
The [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) lays out a long-term vision for modernizing the Federal Government in key areas that will improve the ability of agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.

To drive these management priorities, the Administration leverages [Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/overview/) to coordinate and publicly track implementation across Federal agencies. CAP Goals are updated or revised every four years with each Presidential Administration’s term.

# Why This Matters to the CIO Council #
CAP Goals are a tool used by leadership to accelerate progress on a limited number of Presidential priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration among multiple agencies. Long-term in nature, CAP Goals drive cross-government collaboration to tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies. In this case, CIOs use CAP Goals to drive excellent service and stewardship of technology.

The CAP goals that help drive our efforts include:
